# Capital-Asset-Pricing-Model

## Introduction

In this project, we use the capital asset pricing model to value Apple between the years of 2006 to 2016.

    E(R_{i}) = R_{f}+\beta_{i}(E(R_{m})-R_{f})

This time series includes the global financial crisis, which occured in 2009.

We also use SPDR S&P 500 trust (SPY ETF) as the market, as it is designed to track the S&P 500 stock market index.

Based on the results, interpretations or insights were made about the dataset.

The code is based on my own exploration of Python's functionalities, libraries and YahooFinance API.
